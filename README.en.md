GitHub Actions to automatically add a label to pull requests

## Usage

1. Create a `.github/workflows/simple-labeler.yml` file:

```yml
name: Simple Labeler
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, ready_for_review]
jobs:
  simple-labeler:
    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
    steps:
      - name: Label to PR
        uses: naver/simple-labeler@latest
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          labels: "D-3"
          duplicate: "D-*"
```

2. Specify the events to trigger in `on`. In this example above, a label is added when a PR is created or transitioned from Draft to open status. (Note: it does not trigger on Draft PR creation.)
3. When the specified event occurs, `simple-labeler` automatically adds the label specified in `labels`.

## Inputs

### `token`

**Required** GitHub token

### `labels`

**Required** Labels to add when the event occurs, separated by commas(,)

### `duplicate`

If a label matches this pattern(glob), no new label is added.
